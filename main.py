# FORK ME or copy the code!  Please don't request edit access. This is the original so it needs to stay undedited for all users.

# Task 1

  # The program below uses functions.  Add comments to predict the output in the order that it has been coded here.

def say_hi():
  print("Why hello there!")

def offer_drink():
  print("Would you care for a spot of tea?")

def offer_food():
  print("Biscuit?")

def say_bye():
  print("Cheerio then.")


offer_drink()
say_hi()
offer_food()

# Task 2
  # Rewrite the code to call the functions in the correct order so that the output makes sense chronologically.

  # Call the correct function so that the program says goodbye to the user.


# Task 3

  # Define a new function that tells the user a joke (you decide on the funtion name and the joke).  Call it in a sensible place in the program.
